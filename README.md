- Summarize data in a clean, business-friendly format

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI** (for dashboard creation)

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 📉 **Sales Declined Over Time**: A steady drop from 2015 to 2017 suggests a need to investigate operational or market issues.
- 🧭 **West Region Leads**: Highest sales observed in the West, indicating strong customer presence or better marketing.
- 🪑 **Furniture Dominates**: Currently shows 100% of sales (likely due to slicer); further comparison with other categories recommended.
- 🗓 **Low Seasonality Impact**: Lack of spikes suggests potential for better-timed promotions.
- 🧩 **Interactive Filtering**: Allows tailored analysis across dimensions — time, region, and product.

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Investigate sales drop across 2016–2017.
- Replicate strategies from the high-performing **West** region in other zones.
- Run mid-year promotions to combat low sales periods.
- Unfilter categories to assess performance across **Office Supplies** and **Technology**.

## ✅ Outcome

By using Power BI, we built a sleek, business-ready dashboard that gives users a clear view of sales performance. The interactivity helps non-technical users explore and act on data insights with ease.
